- Body and headline font: 'Poppins', 'Montserrat', or 'Playfair Display' (for headings). Apply the font globally.
- Typography: Bold uppercase headings, clean sans-serif body text.
- Use clean, minimalist icons for navigation and calls to action. Ensure icons are consistent with the overall modern aesthetic.
- Implement a grid-based layout with generous spacing for a clean and organized look. Prioritize mobile-first design.
- Consistent Layout: Wide spacing, grid-based product cards, large hero banner, monochrome product photography.
- Use subtle animations on hover and transitions to add a layer of interactivity without overwhelming the user.
